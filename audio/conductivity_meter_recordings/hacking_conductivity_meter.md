The conductivity meter is a Jenway 4010 Conductivity Meter, which I hacked to create sound by circuit bending off the digital display. The conductivity meter sounds are particularly beautiful because what we are actually hearing is the dying off of the measurement once the probe is removed from the sample. When this happens the value on the display begins to diminish to zero, and it's possible to hear a surge in the sound each time a value on the display passes through the digit "1".
