# the_matter_of_the_soul
The Matter of the Soul is an artistic project exploring dispersal from the perspective of water, culture and identity. It has been initiated by an artist residency in the Arctic with Friends of SPRI (Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge), One Ocean, and Bonhams.

More information on the process and concept of the project can be found at https://katausten.wordpress.com/tag/artist-in-the-arctic/.
